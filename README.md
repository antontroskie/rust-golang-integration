# rust-golang-integration
Here is an example of integrating a Golang library into a Rust application, enabling communication between the two via channels.

This approach demonstrates running a full Golang application as a library, with a Rust application utilizing the Golang library, while maintaining inter-process communication through channels to facilitate bi-directional interaction between the two.

## Running
```
bash run.sh
```
